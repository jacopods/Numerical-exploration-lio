#+title: The spectrum of Linearized Isospectral operators

* Intro
* The main library: ~domain~
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle domain.py
:END:

In this section we create the ~Domain~ class, which will be
responsible for containing and processing information about each
domain.
#+begin_src python
  import math
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#+end_src

The constructor of the class loads a file and parses its content.
The file –for now– is one line of tilde-separated list of pairs a,b,
where

- $a$ is the list of coefficients of the $sin$ Fourier modes of the
  curvature radius
- $b$ is the list of coefficients of the $cos$ Fourier modes of the
  curvature radius

In other words, the curvature radius $ρ$ as a function of the tangent
angle $θ$ is given by:

$$ ρ(θ) = \sum_{k=0}^∞ a_k \sin(kθ) + b_k \cos(kθ) $$

** TODO Modify the code to accept a json file, instead

It would be then easy to store (cache) further information about the
 domain should we want to.


#+begin_src python
  class Domain:
      def __init__(self, fname):
          with open(fname) as fp:
              for line in fp:
                  line = line.strip()
                  self.pairs = line.split('~')
